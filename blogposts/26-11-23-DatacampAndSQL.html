      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Trying to learn SQL through FreeCodeCamp.</p>
      <p> I'm starting the habit of adding to my website in this space weekly with a post that documents my progress and offers 
        reflections of that week. After improving my skills in python and web development, I felt the next step should be learning 
        about databases. This is because it seems clear that this is an essential part of back-end development and data analysis. 
        Another reason is that after developing FMScout, I felt like there was room to improve it by using a relational 
        database to store the information that the app generates. I wanted to learn SQL rather than No-SQL databases first
        as they a) seem to be more widely used in data management and b) more foundational as a back-end skill. 
        I wanted to achieve this by taking freecodecamp's 'Relational Databases' course, however, doing so became difficult.
        The course available is currently under-maintainace and has been for a while now, so therefore the course had to 
        be downloaded remotely and run on my local OS. I tried for 3 weeks to achieve this simple task and ultimately to 
        no avail. I encountered problems with downloading a linux OS to support the docker desktop app that had to be installed
        on my local OS. Docker was needed in order to retrieve the container that would be used to run the course through VS 
        code. Therefore, having 3 different apps running in the correct order, in the correct way and at the same time was 
        very tricky to get right. Docker would open incredibly slowly because my linux system wouldn't be running correctly. 
        And the time taken to just work this out could take an entire evening. I wanted to persevere with this mostly because 
        I loved the freecodecamp course that I had taken before and wanted to do another, but also because I was being stubborn!
        I did get the container to work on my computer, but only for an evening. After this time, I looked for ways to progress
        my learning.

      </figure>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Running before walking.</p>
      <p> I think the biggest reason why I was able to get the remote version of the freecodecamp course to work, was that I 
        was having to use and experiment with coding concepts and commands that I was not yet familiar with, and had no 
        understanding of how to use. For example, the understanding of why I had to install linux in order to make Docker work
        was something that led to errors and slow progress. Another example is how I tried to install MYSQL onto my PC and tried 
        to initiate an SQL database of my own, in order to follow a freecodecamp video tutorial. This was documents before 
        learning how to do this in the right way or the SQL commands used in this program. The one area that did improve in my 
        coding through this process were command line terminal commands.

      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">DataCamp.</p>
      <figure class="blog__img">
        <img src="/img/Datacamp Screenshot.png" alt="" class="blog__img">
        <figcaption>My page of courses on DataCamp</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> On the search for a way to re-initiate my learning, I wanted a service that was 1) low-cost 2) web-based 3) used
        project-based / practical learning and 4) required no more local apps to be installed! I started a course on Udacity,
        got a few parts of the course in, but became uninterested with the lack of practical learning. I then thought I'd try 
        DataCamp. This was a website that I had actually used at the very beginning of my coding journey when I wanted to learn
        python. However, I lost interest with some aspects of that course and went another way. I also didn't continue this 
        because of the paywall that needs passing, that came at a time where I wasn't sure of my total commitment and didn't 
        have a clear understanding of what made a course good for me. 
      </p>
      <p> In this instance, these concerns were no longer present, and knew that the courses on offer would help me. I completed
        a chapter on intermediate SQL commands before hitting a paywall, and signed up using a black-friday deal! This has 
        rocketted my learning and productivity, and I've really enjoyed the learnign that I've done this week. I completed the 
        intermediate SQL commands course in one day, and have since begun another course on terminal commands. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Weekly Reflection.</p>
      <p> This week has been hugely productive. I've overcome an obstacle to my learning and found a great solution to it. 
        I feel like my skills are growing, and that I'm growing as a developer. The biggest lesson learnt, is to be willing 
        to adopt a plan B if needed, rather than persevere for the sake of it. It's this reflection that's inspired me to routinely
        document my progress more; meaning that this blog will become a weekly occurence. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Aims For Next Week.</p>
      <p> In the next week I'd like to finish my course on terminal commands, then move onto learning about NO-SQL commands.
        I'd also like to improve this website, so that my weekly blogposts are more clearly advertised.
