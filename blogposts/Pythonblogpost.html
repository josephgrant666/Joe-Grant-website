      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Establishing what I wanted to learn</p>
      <p>It seems that the main advice that people give when planning a roadmap towards becoming a developer is that first
        of all you should learn a programming language, stick to it, and become as good at that language as possible.
        How I decided on learning Python was because of its simple and intuitive syntax, its widespread use amonngst software
        development, and its versitility in use; whether that be web-development or data-analysis. 
      </p>

      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Starting the learning process</p>
      <p>I began by using a course provided by datacamp. THis was a series of online, interactive video courses that teach python 
        fundamentals. However, this came at a cost that was put in place after the ending of a free trial. This demotivated and halted
        my learning for a while as I was not willing to pay the fee, and wasn't aware of any viable learning alternatives. 
        I then learnt of a book that was written alongside some video tutorials that are created by the author on 
        <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/" target="_blank" class="para__links">
          Udemy.</a> 
        This contained a series of video tutorials that provided a series of interactive guides on different aspects of 
      Python fundamentals. This contained around 50 lessons of varing length and lessons that encouraged me to write 
      code alongside the lessons and build experimental code of my own outside of the lessons themselves.</p>
      <p>I also purchased the textbook to go alongside my video learning, so that I could read into what I had learnt in 
        further detail and revise using the textbook questions and answers. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Lessons learnt</p>
      <p>This was the first step that I took in my programming journey, so there were a lot of lessons learnt along the way! 
        One of the biggest lessons was that routine and consistent application is key. I learnt more when I did little amounts,
      consistently and often, rather than large chunks with weeks apart in between. My process of learning Python took a long time,
      and that's because my pattern of learning was inconsistent, and therefore led to a loss of learning and then having to repeate
      things that had been previously covered.</p>
      <p>Having learnt HTML and CSS fundamentals throught project based learning, I wish I had completed more projects and applied
        my learning to something real more, rather than just get through the video tutorials for the sake of it. This was my first 
        brush with 'tutorial hell'.
