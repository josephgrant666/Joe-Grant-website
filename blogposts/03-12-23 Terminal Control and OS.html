      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Learning terminal commands</p>
      <p> This week as promised, was a week where I continued my course on learning terminal usage and OS commands.
        This included learning commands that searched for, augmented and read files from one's OS. I did this using 
        the course from DataCamp: 'Introduction to Shell' and committed myself to learning more and more each day.

      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Work/life balance</p>
      <p> I made less progress than anticipated this week due to work and life commitments.These things happen! 
        At work I had a lot of mock exams to mark and a fieldtrip to organise, and on Tuesday I attended a flat 
        viewing aftershool, which has then consumed more time organising and signing. All through this however, I 
        found ways to make small amounts of progress and complete learning where I could, all is a plus!
      </p>

        <figcaption>Backend Roadmap</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> I found learning terminal commands a lot more difficult than expected. The commands taught were not too 
        clear and how they were used became a bit complicated. These commands include: grep, more, less, head and 
        tail. I had to revise these repeatedly, and practice them in order to understand their use. The syntax
        around for loops and piping in the terminal will also take some getting used to. 
        In the end, I completed the course and became more confident with these commands, but am not at a good
        level of proficiency yet. I found the course a bit poorly explained, and the practical examples a bit 
        disjointed in their use. 
      </p>
      <p> I then beyonf the main focus of theis week, made some other progress in areas. As mentioned in my 
        upcomings aims from last week, I added a button to the home page of my website, that advertised the blog
        section of the homepage and takes users to that place. I also then revised my use of a roadmap that I had 
        chosen to follow to improve my backend skiils. With this roadmap in mind, I did some reading on internet 
        concepts such as html, https and DNS. As well as this, I've revised my understanding of git by taking a 
        course on version control systems and git. This will help me understand and gain more confidence in my 
        use of git for the future.
      </p>
      <p> I wanted to move onto NOSQL commands and usage last week, but I think to do so would be a bit rushed;
        so for now I'm taking things a bit slower and gaining more confidence in the fundamental skills described.
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Aims For Next Week.</p>
      <p> My aims for next week are to complete the course on git and to start using this to commit files to my 
        github page. I'd then like to complete a course that I had previously begun on python in order to do a bit 
        or revision on my python skills. I'd then also like to understand how to install and use PostgreSQL so that 
        I can start applying databases to my current projects.
