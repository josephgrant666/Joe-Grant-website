      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item"> Finding the right tutorial 
      </p>
      <p>Finding a guide that both comprehensively and simply taught me skills in buidling an API proved to 
        be a tough task. I had previously relied on DataCamp and freecodecamp to provide resources on how to
        learn a new skill. However, in this case there were no courses that taught how to create an API in 
        Python. Therefore I had to search for YouTube videos that would do the same job. I thought I had 
        already done so when I wrote my last post last week, however this tutorial was far too complicated,
        and created too many problems. I wanted a tutorial that not only got you building, but explained the 
        syntax too, so that I could use it independently later on. The tutorial I chose before didn't do this, 
        and also introduced third party modules/dependencies that just complicated things further.

      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">freecodecamp API tutorial</p>
      <p> I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=11162s" target="_blank">this</a> video 
        from the freecodecamp YouTube channel that is a <strong> 19 hour </strong>video on how to build an API 
        project. This course aims to build a CRUD application using FastAPI, virtual environments, Postman, 
        Postgres databases and Docker. It is comprehensive to say the least, and does a fantastic job of explaining 
        concepts in detail. Plus, the instructor is humble and makes me feel at ease! 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Virtual environments and PATH operations</p>
      <p> The first part of the video introduces the course and explains what the project will be, and then takes 
        you through the steps of how to set up the project. This includes installing programs, dependencies, and 
        setting up a virtual environment. This was my first time using one, but quickly understood that it was a) 
        a practice that is used in professional settings, and b) good practice as it ensures that other users can 
        access the app and its dependencies when run locally. The PATH commands for this were a bit tricky to 
        create, as my PC wasn't authrosising some of them, and this requires some patient fixes. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">CRUD operations and Postman</p>
      <p> The next part of the video goes through one by one, how to create API CRUD operations and the meaning 
        behind each piece of code. This included features such as decorators, classes and API initiation. There was 
        an extensive section for POST, PUT, GET and DELETE operations. Alongside this, the tutorial uses Postman 
        as a GUI for visualising your API operations. I'm finding Postman incredibly straightforward and 
        user-friendly.
      </p>

          </figure>
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Postgres SQL Database</p>
      <p> The next step was to initiate a postgres database. Being interested career-wise in database management,
        I'm really enjoyng this. The video took me through how to initiate a Postgres database server, create 
        a table, and insert rows and columns. It took me 4 hours to solve an issue when trying to set this up 
        yesterday, only to realise that the problem was that I had used a non-alpha-numeric character in my 
        Postgres password, which meant that the program and database cluster wasn't able to be installed 
        properly. The key, as always though, was staying calm and patient. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Aims for next week</p>
      <p> Very simply, is to try and complete more of the tutorial and expand my skills. I have a lot more tutorial
        to watch! I've also been documenting different pieces of code as I go, to then be added to my 'Python Functions'
        repo on GitHub. I'll continue to do this, and think that it's a really healthy habit to maintain whilst I learn.
