    <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Establishing what I wanted my website to be</p>
    <p>Through my research about the roadmap that having a website to blog about and showcase my progress was 
      essential. Therefore, after learning the fundamentals of python, my net step was to build a website. 
      The advantages of this being that I would add another skill to my developer toolkit through project-based
      learning, and end up with a product that was something that I could make changes to if needed, as I'm 
      the person who has built it.

    <div class="blog__item"></div>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Learning HTML and CSS</p>
      <p>I began by using 
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn" target="_blank" class="para__links">
          freecodecamp</a> to begin learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This resource was 
        excellent; the site is free to use, and the fundamentals are learnt via completing projects.
        This is the best way to learn as it engaged me into by 'doing' rather than being stuck in so-called 
        'tutorial hell'. This process took around a month, before I then was able to start building my website
        from scratch.</p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Project-based learning</p>
      <p>As I completed different project lessons, I would then experiment with the code that I had learnt
        and use it to create web-pages of my own. This would help me learn faster as I would have to take the
        code that I had learnt and then find otehr uses for it. I saved my progress bit-by-bit by committing 
        the code to a github repository. This was a good thing to do as it backed-up by files but also meant 
        that I was maintaining consistent github commits and keeping my profile as active as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Building the website</p>
      <p>During my half term break, I worked everyday during the week from 8am-3pm on this project.
        This largely involved following freecodecamp's guide by Kevin Powell that provided the boiler-plate code
        and steps needed to make the website live. This was a good guide that needed to be followed after completing 
        the freecodecamp projects, as there were a few moments where the code he provided didn't quite work out for
        me and I had to make my own adjustments. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Lessons learnt</p>
      <p>Like I said before, there were times where I had to correct some code and use my intuition and skills to make
        the code work for me. This meant that I simply had to be patient, revisit some of the code that I had written
        on freecodecamp and sometimes use google as my best friend! 
      <p>I did think about attempting to write the code for the website entirely on my own first before following the
        video, but I'm ultimately glad that I didn't; the video that I followed provided excellent guidance. It gave 
        great boiler-plate code, formatting and layout and tips on the use of custom classes and CSS variables. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Making the website live</p>
      <p>The only thing that the video I followed did not do, was give instructions on then how to make a website go live.
        To do this, I used FileZilla to upload my website files and folders to a cloud server. I then obtained these files
        using a DigitalOcean droplet. This is a service that takes locally stored files, and stores them on the cloud so 
        that they can be redirected to a DNS server. I then obtained a domain name via NameCheap. I had some initial issues
        connecting this to my website's IP address, but quickly learnt that I had to verify my email address first and 
        also wait for NameCheap to establish the domain.
