      <p> The main focus of this week was to learn Git commands in order to work and learn collaboratively and 
        store files on Github. This was done using a course on DataCamp. I completed the course and now feel a 
        lot more confident on using git to update and track my workflow.

      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Small prgoress</p>
      <p> This week was plagued with work commitments. I already knew that my time would be limited by a fieldtrip
        that I was running on Wednesday, but then on Monday, the dreaded call from OFSTED came to my school. 
        This is a rigorous inspection process of a school, where the effaciacy of a school's provision is investigated 
        in all areas by four inspectors. In addition to this, selection of subjects are chosen for a 'deep=dive', where
        they become the focus of the inspection and face far more scrutiny than subjects that are not part of this 
        process.
      </p>
      <p> And to my surprise, the subject that I'm responsible for (geography) was chosen to be 'deep-dived'. This 
        meant that my week was dominated by preparation and participation in this inspection. There was no spare time,
        and my energy was entirely dedicated to this process. This meant that my time for coding had to come later in 
        the week. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Aims For Next Week.</p>
      <p> My main aim for the week was to learn Git commands and I did so. However, I did want to learn more about 
        PostgreSQL and start using it for projects; so I'll keep my aim simple this week and make this my focus.
        I think that I will have to lower my expectations about how much I can achieve over the Christmas period, 
        especially as I am planning on moving flats in the coming weeks.
