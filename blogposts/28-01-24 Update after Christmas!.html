      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">What's happened since the last blogpost</p>
      <p> Before Christmas in my last post, I warned that blogposts and my coding activity may take a hit during the 
        Christmas break and ultimately it did. There was a period of 10 days or so where I made no commmits to my github 
        and wasn't able to stick to my usual routines. However this is for good reason; a combination of moving flat that 
        then had restricted internet access until 09-01-24 and visiting multiple family members over the Christmas break
        meant that I just had to accpet the change to the norm. I also embraced the idea that it was good for me to take 
        some time away to relax.  
      </p>
      <p> This didn't however mean that I took a total break away from learning. Since I last posted, I have made significant 
        progress in multiple concepts and developed existing projects further.         
      </p>
      <figure class="blog__img">
        <img src="/img/Intermediate Python Course.png" alt="" class="blog__img">
        <figcaption>Intermediate Python Course</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">MatPlotLib and NumPy</p>
      <p> I took a course in Intermediate Python on DataCamp in order to progress my skills in Python and in particular,
        with Data Science and Visualisation. This was the progressive course to 'Introduction to Python', and I chose it 
        because I had enjoyed the previous course. The new course dealt in MatPlotLib, NumPy and Flow Contral Statements.
        This was an excellent course, as it allowed me to understand how to create arrays, perform operations on them, then
        present data with customisation. I learnt so much from this, and then used it to enhance existing projects.
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">FMScout 2.0.0</p>
      <p> When learning these new concepts, I thought that the perfect place to apply these skills was FMScout; as it is 
        an app that deals with data arrays, and then the manipulation and presentation of them. Therefore, I adapted the 
        app to perform NumPy operations on the existing Pandas data arrays, and then use MatPlotLib to present the data to
        the user. This could be used for both team analysis and scouting. 
      </p>
      <p> This was a tricky task. There was a lot of code to write in order to build the dataframe in the correct way, 
        perform data type manipulations to it, and then write the code that built multiple formats of data presentation,
        with customisation to highlight data that fulfilled a certain criteria. However, I massively enjoyed it and 
        through perserverance and trial and error, produced a program that worked as planned. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Custom Tkinter - GUI for Python</p>
      <p> Upon completing the app, it then frustrated me that I wasn't able to make this app functional in any kind of 
        user-friendly way, and that GUI was mostly written using react and JavaScript. Therefore, I went about finding 
        a way of creating a GUI that gave my apps UI functionality, but without spending too much time sweating over the 
        details of this. 
      </p>
      <p> After researching this, I found a module for Python called 'Custom Tkinter'. This lacks the customisation and 
        front-end appeal of something like React.Js, but is able to provide some front-end for my apps without having to
        learn JavaScript. I used <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y01r643ckfI&t=1s&pp=ygUOY3VzdG9tIHRraW50ZXI%3D" 
        target="_blank">this</a> series of videos to learn the code, and then I applied it to FMScout. The code for this 
        did become tricky in places, as I had to glue together the code that I had already produced, to the functionality
        of the Custom Tkinter features. However, I ended up with a much more user friendly app that can be used alongside 
        the game with a lot more ease.

          </figure>
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">APIs</p>
      <p> After completing this to a point where I was happy using it, I then began learning my next programming concept
        that I have always wanted to understand, due to its seeming imprtance to back-end development; APIs. This is a 
        current work in progress, and I'm still in the stage of learning its functionality and syntax. From what it seems 
        there are a number of ways of creating APIs, but I wanted to do so in Python. Therefore, I've begun learning REST 
        APIs through the module Flask. There are limited courses and tutorials in this area, which is frustrating due to 
        its importance. I have however, been making notes and using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMppyAPbLYk"
        target="_blank">this</a> video to a reasonable amount of success so far. Learning this has by far been the hardest 
        concept to learn so far. This is mostly because the syntax is not straightforward, and no one explains it very well!
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Taking fundamental notes and committing them to github</p>
      <p> What I also thought would be a productive use of time and a good series of commits to make to my github, would be
        a repo that stores fundamental code in different areas. This contains folders for 'Data Visualisation' or 'Pandas'
        or 'Dictionaries' so that if needed and I need to brush up on concepts or input some boilerplate code into a program,
        then I could easily do so. This repo also documents my progress and shows my capabilities. 
      </p>
      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Next week</p>
      <p> In the coming week I'm going to focus solely on learning APIs and then begin to implement them into my back-end 
        projects in order to provide both universalisation and authentication. If possible, I'm also going to add to my 
        Python Functions repo, and add GUIs to other projects.
