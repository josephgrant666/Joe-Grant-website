      <p>This project was the first moment that I felt like after learning different skills and building my confidence, it was time 
        to build an app of use that displayed my skills and could be developed more and more as an ongoing project. I wanted to build 
        something that a) was useful to me, b) I would have fun building and c) could integrate the skills that I had learnt.  
      </p>
      <p> Football manager is my favourite game to play and as a backend developer, I saw it as the perfect focus for my first project.
        The game heavily relies upon the use of data in order to create gameplay for the user, but involves a lot of guessing and 'feeling'.       
        I wanted to find a way of removing this and manipulating the data in my own way in order to optimise my performance in the game.

      <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--article-item">Context and aims of the project.</p>
      <p> Football manager is a game where players are asked to replicate the role of a real-life manager of a professional football team. 
        Players amongst other roles such as recruiting staff, managing tactical selection and renewing contracts, assemble a squad of 
        players that will win the most games possible. In order to do this, players are assigned around 30 attributes in order to assess 
        their ability to perform, such as 'Strength', 'Agility', 'Decisions', 'Finishing' or 'Passing'. These attributes are given a 
        number from 1 to 20; 1 is the worst, 20 is the best. Therefore, the higher the number for a player's attributes, the better they 
        are at the game. 
      </p>
      <p> The other main reason why this is important is because player will often perfrom in different positions on the football pitch,
        and perform in different tactical roles when in that position; such as a 'Central defender (Defend)' is responsible for defensive 
        positioning and stopping goals from being conceded, where as a 'Attacking midfielder (Attack)' is responsible for creating and scoring 
        goal-scoring opportunities. Each of these roles require different attributes in order to be effective in that role, so therefore
        some players will be better suited to some roles more than others. For example, a 'Central defender (Defend)' will need strong 'Aggression', 
        'Heading' and 'Positioning' attributes, whereas an 'Attacking midfielder (Attack)' will need strong 'Passing', 'Vision' and 'Anticipation'
        attributes. What this therefore means is that a player's suitability for a role can be calculated and determined as a matter of fact. 
        However, the game does not do this for you, and will display a player's attributes and highlight which attributes they need for the 
        selected role, but will leave the efficacy of their attributes for that role down to your judgement as a player. I therefore wanted 
        to build a program that took away the guessing and produced scores and rankings for different players based on their suitability
        for tactical roles that were in question.
